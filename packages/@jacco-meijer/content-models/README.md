# @jacco-meijer/content-models

## DEPRECATED

All content has been removed, this package became obsolete.

Having a more explicit config in each project and generate models and queries
from that is easier to main.

- Component models and queries can be generated by using the new wheelroom version
- Page and article model helpers are moved to the boilerplate
- model types are moved to the wheelroom package
