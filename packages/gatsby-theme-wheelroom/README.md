# gatsby-theme-wheelroom

A generic `gatsby-node.js` built on consistent models and fragments, which takes
care of pulling data from Contentful.

## Wheelroom

The theme requires some graphql to be defined. This can be generated by using
`wheelroom` and the plugin `wheelroom-plugin-graphql`.


## Query types

The theme can handle three query types:

- page: pages have a path and pathName which are used to create the actual pages
- subPage: subPages have a slug from which the path is created
- global: global data is added to every page

## Configuration

The components to use are configured in `wheelroom-config.js`. It simply tells
the plugin which npm module to get the components from. A module name can be
prefixed with `my/module/path:`. This will resolve the module from this path abd
makes it easy to initially develop you module from your local repository.

## Install

Install the plugin by adding it to your `gatsby-config.js`

```javascript
// Wheelroom generated files with graphql
const articleQuery = require('./src/graphql/article-query')
const globalsQuery = require('./src/graphql/globals-query')
const pageQuery = require('./src/graphql/page-query')

module.exports = {
  plugins: [
    {
      options: {
        defaultLocale: 'nl',
        pageTemplate: path.resolve('./src/page-template.tsx'),
        queries: [articleQuery, globalsQuery, pageQuery],
      },
      resolve: `gatsby-theme-wheelroom`,
    },
...
```
